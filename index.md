Under construction, stolen from the generous Karl Broman's simple site (of which a lot of material remains, see below).

Here are some of my projects (or will be, when I replace Karl's stuff):

- [Rubus hybrid](pages/rubus.html)
- [RepeatKmer](pages/repeat_kmer.html)
- [Old genetics paper translation](pages/woltereck.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)

If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.
