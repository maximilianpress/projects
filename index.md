Under construction, stolen from the generous Karl Broman's simple site (of which a lot of material remains, see below).

Here are some of my projects (or will be, when I replace Karl's stuff):

- [Rubus hybrid](pages/rubus.html)
- [RepeatKmer](pages/repeat_kmer.html)
- [Old genetics paper translation](pages/woltereck.html)

See also my [github account](https://github.com/maximilianpress/) and [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o76x5xQAAAAJ) if you're interested in what I'm working on and I haven't updated this in a while.
