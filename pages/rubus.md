# Rubus hybridization
Calling this a project is a bit of an overstatement. But nonetheless I am curious to investigate further. The data are as follows:

 1. I was told by amateur botanists in the North Cascades that a particular sort of blackberry was a hybrid between the native *Rubus ursinus* and the invasive *Rubus armeniacus*. These are characterized by a distinctive pedate structure that is distinct from the usual obtuse shape of *R. armeniacus* (himalayan blackberry). In other ways the plant strongly resembles *R. armeniacus*, including the robust thorns etc.

 2. In a general way I noted the incidence of such blackberries, particularly in the urbanized Seattle area. They generally seem to occur with both of their parents, if you look hard enough. No surprise, I thought. 
 3. I finally researched the subject beyond mere idle observation, and discovered that this is apparently not recorded in the (attainable) literature. For example, Clark and Jaseniuk presented a poster showing leaf forms for the hybrid that do not show the lobed structure. Moreover, they note that hybridization is relatively rare between the species in a follow-up paper. 
 4. After some blind grasping I found images of the supposed hybrid, which is described as a different cultivar introduced from Eurasia, *Rubus laciniatus*, or the cutleaf blackberry. I was considerably surprised by this.
 5. Apparently all of these plants are in a bit of a polyploid mess, and a considerable amount of work has gone into describing them and their hybrids. It is not clear that they are stable species. 

 What exactly is going on here? I would say based on my experience that it is likely a hybrid, but according to the literature I've been going around telling people lies about this for some years (as it's a fairly common, charismatic example of a hybrid!). 

 I'd like to figure out the truth of the matter.
