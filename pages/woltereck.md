title: Translating old genetics papers
description: Woltereck and beyond.

I translate papers from German into English that other people haven't translated yet. It's fun and I learn a lot doing it. At some point I'll go into my motivation for doing so, but for now here is a list of my translations at present:

 * [Woltereck 1909 (reaction norms)](https://osf.io/fvme6/)
 * [Keilhack 1909 (review of Woltereck 1909)](https://osf.io/5szyd/)
 * [Johannsen 1903 (pure lines)](https://osf.io/mksrb/)
 * [Woltereck 1911 (acquired characters; needs editing)](https://osf.io/29vt3)
