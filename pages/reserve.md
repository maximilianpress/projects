The reserve committee has a lot of ideas about how to implement a reserve fund that is:

 1. Financially viable
 2. Equitable 
 3. Minimizes burdens on current co-op members

This page links to some of the information and proposals that we have put together.

## Reserve committee proposals
The following are specific proposals that the reserve committee has considered.

### Financing the reserve through move-in fees
In fall of 2019, the reserve committee presented the board with a [proposal for increased move-in fee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAA3FawEVH3gLhwMKtprO_gY47m4A_UAowPGWhnAYOE/edit?usp=sharing). 

The board chose not to pursue this proposal at the time. We are hopeful that it will be considered at the 2021 general meeting.

This fee **reduces the financial burden on co-op members** and **is paid by buyer, not by seller**.

* We already assess a move-in fee for all residents, to recoup our legal costs.
* We don't need to alter the bylaws to charge this.
* We can use proceeds from the flip tax to **reduce reserve dues**.
* [Reserve projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lAlINrAk8BXSmkt7vZgVCZMQRBe4tOPhvajae3qdLv8/edit?usp=sharing) suggest that we can dramatically reduce reserve dues to co-op members with a move-in fee, assuming 1-2 sales each year (which is about average).

### Investing the reserve fund.
The reserve committee proposed to invest the reserve fund, to maximize the impact of the reserve and reduce burdens on residents. This was put into effect (in a limited fashion) in Summer 2020. 

You can read the original proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xfxSYDfT-RAno-YfdHlMVE9C6Ld5_xocduSqmhnqV30/edit?usp=sharing), and the implementation proposal for that specific investment [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gpm77lCfzzzafdMxDvEHRMC8SBfo15VOwTwLCJWtYaw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Sliding-scale reserve dues payments
We also explored the idea of sliding-scale payments into the reserve, with the idea that this would be a way to enforce equity, as many Marquis members (specifically long-time members) moved in at a time when dues were significantly lower, and living here was significantly more affordable. Supporting all of our co-op members is critical, and maintaining our community is important, so we wanted to investigate a way to do that with the reserve fund.

We prepared a [proposal for the board on two different implementation mechanisms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUKoKkR0LdQErwu28sGl0Zh2MM4e_vChXbS6FSzauew/edit?usp=sharing).
