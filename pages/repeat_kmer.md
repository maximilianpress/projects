This is one of those projects that occurred to me as I lay awake waiting for the baby to stop yelling. I doubt that it has any particular novelty to it (though I haven't found a direct precursor), but working through it clarified how I think about sequences in genomes, and what exactly I mean by "repeat". It takes a k-mer-based rather than alignment-based approach to repeat inference in genomes.

It is starting off as a [private repo](https://github.com/maximilianpress/RepeatKmer) that I am working on until it is semi-functional, and then possibly making public.

I will add more details as the code develops.
